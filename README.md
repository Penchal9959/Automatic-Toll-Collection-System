# Automatic_Toll_Collection_System
This project is an automatic toll collection system using RFID card reader. We can clear the traffic as much as fast at the toll plazas using this system. The vehicle owner should attach the recharged RFID tag in front of the vehicle. The RFID reader placed at the toll collection plaza will automatically read that tag and the money will be deducted from that tag.
