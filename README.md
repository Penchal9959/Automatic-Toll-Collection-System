# Automatic-toll-collection-plaza
This project is an automatic toll plaza using RFID card reader. We can clear the traffic at the toll plazas using this project. The vehicle owner should attach the recharged RFID tag in front of the vehicle. The RFID reader placed at the toll collection plaza will automatically read that tag and the money will be deducted from that tag.
